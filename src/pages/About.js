        <h1> About The Food Store</h1>
        <p>Founded in early 2024, The Food Store's mission was to have a compelling business that could be used for a mid term project. After countless hours of brainstorming, we came up with the concept of The Food Store, because everybody needs food. 
        </p><p>
            Our dedication to our customers sets us apart from other stores created for this project. We go above and beyond to offer customer support ontop of an engaging web experience.
